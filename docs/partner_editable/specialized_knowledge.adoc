=== Assumptions

This Quick Start assumes the following:

* Meter data has already been validated and processed by the MDM system.
* Weather data, while not required, is recommended because it produces insights when correlated with unusual energy usage.
* Data from a customer information system (CIS), while not required, is recommended because it produces insights related to customer energy usage.
