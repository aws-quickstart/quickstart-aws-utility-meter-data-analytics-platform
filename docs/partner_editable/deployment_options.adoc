// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start creates a serverless architecture in your AWS account. As part of the deployment, it creates an Amazon Redshift cluster, which is created in a private subnet within a VPC.

For deployment of the Amazon Redshift cluster, this Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, the subnet, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys an Amazon Redshift cluster into the new VPC.
* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into an existing VPC*. This option provisions an Amazon Redshift cluster in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, the number of digital processing units (DPUs) for AWS Glue jobs, and the source S3 bucket, as discussed later in this guide.
