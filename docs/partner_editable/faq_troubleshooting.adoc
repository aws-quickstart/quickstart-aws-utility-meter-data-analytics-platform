== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *No*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information about AWS CloudFormation quotas, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation^].

//TODO Shivansh, Follow this FAQ, do you know why the guide includes only the parameters for launching into a new VPC?

//TODO Shivansh, In Table 10, the five descriptions simply repeat the info in the labels. We'll want to define those five items instead, or say something helpful about each. (Please leave this comment in the doc until we've addressed this.)

//TODO Shivansh, Table 11 mentions Availability Zones. Are they part of this Quick Start? If so, we need to review those descriptions. (Please leave this comment in the doc until we've addressed this.)

//TODO Shivansh, I haven’t edited the parameter descriptions in workload.yaml yet. I want to confirm my edits in the main template with you before I copy them in. (Please leave this comment in the doc until we've addressed this.)
