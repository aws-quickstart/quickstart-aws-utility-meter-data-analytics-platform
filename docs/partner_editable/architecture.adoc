Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

//TODO Shivansh, Do you know why Figure 1, above, gets an outline applied while the figures that really need the outline (the screen shots) do not? See Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. We created the outlining standard specifically for screen shots. How do we fix this at the global level?

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A VPC configured with a private subnet, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the private subnet, an Amazon Redshift cluster that stores business data for analysis, visualization, and dashboards.
* An extract, transform, load (ETL) pipeline:
** S3 buckets to store data from an MDM or similar system. Raw meter data, clean data, and partitioned business data are stored in separate S3 buckets.
** An AWS Glue workflow:
*** Crawlers, jobs, and triggers to crawl, transform, and convert incoming raw meter data into clean data in the desired format and partitioned business data.
*** AWS Glue Data Catalog to store metadata and source information about the meter data.
* An ML pipeline:
** Two AWS Step Functions workflows:
*** Model training, which uses the partitioned business data to build an ML model.
*** Batch processing, which uses the partitioned business data and the data from the model as a basis for forecasting. 
** Amazon S3 for storing the processed data.
** Amazon Sagemaker for real-time forecasting of energy usage.
** A Jupyter notebook with sample code to perform data science and data visualization.
* AWS Lambda to query the partitioned business data through Amazon Athena or invoke Amazon Sagemaker to provide API query results.
* Amazon API Gateway to deliver API query results for energy usage, anomalies, and meter outages.

[.small]#*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#

//TODO Shivansh, Table 11 refers to Availability Zones. If those parameters belongs in this Quick Start, we need to add Availability Zones in the archicture diagram and mention them in the bulleted list.
